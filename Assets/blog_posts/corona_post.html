        <tr><td><p>Since the first case was reported in the Wuhan province of china in december, the number of cases <br>
            of people with the corona virus has increased rapidly. The origin of the virus is traced to an animal <br> 
            market in Wuhan. Even though the virus has killed a little over 4500 people world wide, the total number<br>
            of reported cases so far has reached 120,000 making the mortality rate of about 2%. This implies that the <br>
            virus is far less deadly than SARS (an outbreak recorded in 2003 with mortality rate of 10%) or MERS <br>
            (asimilar outbreak that reached a mortality rate of 34%) but is far mor transmittable. The WHO has <br>
            declared the disease as a pandemic today with president Tewodros Admassu outlining some precautions to <br>
            take to avoid contracting the virus has outline some precautions. Even though there is no known cure or <br>
            vaccine for the illness, here are some of the steps you can take to keep yourself healthy. <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Don't Panic: Even though the virus is infectious it is far less deadly than previous outbreaks like <br>
                the Ebola virus. This means that even if you have the virus there is a high probability of survival. <br>
                </li>
                <li>Avoid wearing surgical masks: surgical masks are designed for doctors so that they can avoid splatters <br>
                during surgery from patients; It is not a proven scientific fact that they can prevent transmission of the virus <br>
                A better alternative is a N95 or N99 fitted masks which have built in air filterers.    
                </li>
                <li>Keep persona hygiene: the virus is mainly transmitted through cough droplets (much like the common cold) so <br>
                    having good hygiene like washing hands repeatedly, avoid touching surfaces can go a long way in stopping <br>
                    the transmission cycle
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid touching face: Make sure you wash your hands after you've touched any surface. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid crowded places: Crowded places have high probability of infection from the virus. <br>
                    so as much as possible people should avoid them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Self-quarantine: If you have been showing symptoms of the illness or has recently been to <br>
                    a country with known cases avoid contact with people and seek the advice of health professionals.
                </li>
            </ol>

        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to find the balance between hysteria and negligence. But it is also wise to remember that <br>
            if you follow the necessary there is no reason to panic.
